For a one dimensional map the sensitivity to initial
conditions is observable through \textit{Lyapunov exponents}.
A system evolved from two slightly different initial states: 
$(x)$ and $(x+\delta x)$, their divergence is characterized as:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:2.1}
    f^n (x+\delta x) - f^n (x) \approx \delta x\, e^{\lambda n}
\end{equation}

,where $n$ is the $n^{th}$ iterate in $f^n (x)$ and 
$\lambda$ is the average rate of divergence and the Lyapunov exponent.
Where $\lambda$ is negative, $f^n (x)$ and $f^n (x+\delta x)$ 
converge as $n \to \infty$. If $\lambda$ is positive 
$f^n (x)$ and $f^n (x+\delta x)$ diverge; the system 
is sensitive to initial conditions \cite{baker}.
\eqref{eq:2.1} can be written as:

$$
ln \left[ \frac{f^n (x+\delta x) - f^n (x)}{\delta x} \right] \approx n \lambda
$$

as $\delta x \to 0$, this equation takes the form

$$
\frac{1}{n} ln\left| \frac{f^n (x)}{\delta x} \right| \approx \lambda
$$

Applying the chain rule to the derivative of 
the $n^{th}$ iteration and taking the limit of $n \to \infty$

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:2.2}
    \lambda = \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} ln|f'(x_i)|
\end{equation}

\subsection{Methodology}
$$
x_{n+1}\, =\, \mu x_n ( 1 - x_n)
$$

The Lyapunov exponent is obtained for two functions 
$f^n (x)$ and $f^n (x+\delta x)$ and then mapped for
the corresponding value of $\mu$ for which the two 
equations have been solved.
To achieve this a Python script executes as such:

\textbf{function} $= \mu \times \textbf{function} \times (1 - \textbf{function})$
\textbf{d\_function} $= \mu \times \textbf{ d\_function} \times (1 - \textbf{d\_function})$.

Initially the pair is solved for some constant 
between 0 and 1, which remains the same every 
time the function runs again, and 
in the case of this program $=0.2$. The iterations 
thereafter follow the expected mechanism, where 
the result becomes the starting point.
The script solves the pair $N$ times, and obtains 
a value for \textbf{sigma}

$$
\textbf{sigma}\, =ln \left[ \frac{|f^n (x+\delta x) - f^n (x)|}{\delta x} \right]
$$

All values of \textbf{sigma} are summed and 
divided by their count 
$N$; $\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} \textbf{sigma}_i$
Thus the Lyapunov exponent is obtained by

$$
\lambda \, =\, \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} ln \left[ \frac{|f^i (x+\delta x) - f^i (x)|}{\delta x} \right]
$$

The plot is produced by mapping $\lambda$ 
for all values of $\mu$.
